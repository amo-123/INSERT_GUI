Main modification in Clinical Case made by Zoltán Papp and Botond Tölgyesi: 
- Data format and ordering changes in the converter files: _Convert\MexDataConverter.c and _Convert\MexPlayDataConverter.c. In this clinical case you need a header file in the main folder: clinicalParameters.h
- Python part of INSERT GUI is commented since the corrected images is enough in raw format
- BaseLine parameter is introduced to _GenerateCorrections\MexSPEngine_08insert.c and _GenerateCorrections\MexSPEngine_10insertUCECLin.c and with setting from outside (good value: ~ 100-110). 
  The reasons: without BaseLine shift the Anger-image is collapsed and it is not effective as a pre-image for StatisticMethod-imaging. (Holes and peaks can show up otherwise).
  If BaseLine is set under the calib process, the same value has to set for playing the acqusitions - bacause of the effect of the energy shift and correct energy correction
- LRF improving by the evaluation code (based on line-measurements) is commented - it has a too smoothing property.
- The starting LRF is come from the flood field images and the reconstruction implemented by Michele O. .  
  The LRF sfit is generated by Debora Salvado and Kjell Erlandsson - little notice: the x_0 and y_0 parameter is mixed, so I put them in a correct order in the LRFwriteFromSfit.m script.
  the sfit datas are in the _TMP\LRF_2017-10-26_bulmaraw_H#node_F.mat
- The Documentation folder created for the Preclinical case: the operation of the GUI is the same, except you can not choose the flood field image for all node toghether only separated ( e.g. bulmaraw_H03_F.data)
